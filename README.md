Function: this app allows people in catastrophic situations to call for help and receive information about volunteers near them through SMS.   
Description: a script keeps a tab on current catastrophes. When users hit on the help button, his location maps him to a catastrophy. Tweets about this catastrophe are analysed and people in the area willing to help are sent a confirmation request message. Once they confirm, their location is mapped to current catastrophies and they receive a list of contact information for that specific location who they can reach out to for help.
